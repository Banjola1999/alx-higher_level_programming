# Object Oriented Programming
## Classes and Objects  
Class is like a template and an Object is created based  on that template  
Data access is restricted. Methods control the access of data  
## OOP Principles
- Encapsulation: hiding and protecting data(attributes)  
- Data Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
  
## Attributes
´´´__dic__´´´ stores the class attributes  

## Methods 
These are functions  
## Properties vs. Getters and Setters

Getters and setters are used to protect private attributes  
Properties are used in Python in place of getters and setters  

## Public instead of Private Attributes
