# principles of OOP
1. Encapsulation
2. Data Abstraction
3. Polymorphism
4. Inheritance

## Data Encapsulation
Bundling together data with methods of accessing and changing the data. 
to achieve encapsulation of data, we have 2 different methods: 
Getter methods: used to access/retrieve attribute's values 
Setter methods: used to change attribute's values. 

The pythonic way of using getters and setter is using properties.   

The are 2 types of methods in OOP
1. Instance Methods: takes in self(object) as the first parameter. references the class.
2. Class methods: takes in clc(class) as the first parameter. references the instance.
3. Static methods: does not take sel or cls as parameters. reference both the class and the instance.

The are 3 types of attributes in OOP
1. class attributes
2. instance attributes

This attributes can be public, private or protected.
